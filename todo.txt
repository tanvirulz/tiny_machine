* organize .h .c and test_suit files.
* make a stmarter Makefile
* write a readme
* create a wiki?  
* add comments and documentations
* before first release version update resister_count


Resolved:

* create debug mode printer. 
 -  [10/6/2018] I had to juggle with the Makefile to add the detest and test mode printouts. 
    Maybe, I should figure out how to give input to make commands. But then that would lose 
    the main purpose I am using make (to be able to run/compile with shor commands). 

* resolve the execution_status_translation multiple definition error during linking issue. 


 -  [10/6/2018] If you want a specific variable to be in an include file (.h) . Make it an 'extern' 
    all assignment to it should happen from the associated .c file. 
    Otherwise when speratly compiled modules meet together which happen to include the same .h file 
    will find multiple instance of the variable and throw error.
