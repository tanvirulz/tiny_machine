 -  [10/6/2018] If you want a specific variable to be in an include file (.h) . Make it an 'extern' 
    all assignment to it should happen from the associated .c file. 
    Otherwise when speratly compiled modules meet together which happen to include the same .h file 
    will find multiple instance of the variable and throw error.
